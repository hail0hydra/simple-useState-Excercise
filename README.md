# `useState()` Excercises


<br>

## What is this?

- this repository contains 4 components I build to better understand `useState()` react hook.

- I haven't touched `useEffect()` hook and I also haven't used `localStorage`. So everything wipes out when you refresh :)

- the four components are namely:

```
- Counter.jsx
- TodoList.jsx
- Profile.jsx
- ShoppingList.jsx
```

- these can be found inside the `src/components` directory

## How to run

- To run these just use `npm` or `bun`

<br>

```bash
bun install
bun dev

# OR

npm install
npm run dev
```
